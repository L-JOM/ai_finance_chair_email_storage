Hey Landon,Thank you, I greatly appreciate that!I completely understand regarding the partnership. Nike has been a great supporter of GTSBE, so I would have loved to see that relationship expand to the regional level.Outside of formal partnerships, we also welcome in-kind donations of any kind to help support our pre-collegiate and community service initiatives. If that's something you'd be open to and fits the budget, we'd also love the opportunity to collaborate in that capacity.Otherwise, if you have any questions or would be interested in exploring a partnership in future years, I’d be happy to set up a call and walk you through our programs and community outreach efforts.The Nike internship postings are on radar, I look to forward to seeing you this semester.Thanks,Jurmain Mitchell2025-2026 Region III Finance Chairperson National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)Cell: (772) 521-4128|  Email: r3finance@nsbe.orgNSBE's mission is to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICEThis message and its attachments, if any, are confidential.

Hey Travis, Thank You, it looks great. I have forwarded this to our Pre Collegiate Initiative Chair and he will be going over it with our advisors. He will be able to get back to you confirming the proposal, the latest being the first week of October. Also, with FRC coming up he estimated that we can start planning to have the workshops early-mid November.I remember you had some interest in maybe having a workshop for FRC.  Are you still interested or is there any other information I can provide for you for it?Thanks, Jurmain Mitchell2025-2026 Region III Finance Chairperson National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)Cell: (772) 521-4128|  Email: r3finance@nsbe.orgNSBE's mission is to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICEThis message and its attachments, if any, are confidential.

Hi Steven,

Thank you for reaching out and for NIKE’s interest in supporting NSBE and FRC. I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss sponsorship possibilities and how we can collaborate.

I’m available next week (Pacific Time) at:
- Tuesday, Sep 23, 2:00–4:00 PM PT
- Wednesday, Sep 24, 9:00–11:00 AM PT
- Friday, Sep 26, 1:00–3:00 PM PT

Please let me know which slot works for you. If none of these fit, share your availability and preferred meeting format (Zoom/Teams/in-person). Also, if you have any initial ideas or goals for the collaboration, feel free to share so we can tailor the discussion.

Looking forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,
Jurmain Mitchell
